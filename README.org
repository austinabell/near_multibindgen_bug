* The following documents a bug with the =near_bindgen= attribute.
To reproduce the bug:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Try building with =./build=. Fail.
3. Try building with =cargo build=. Succeed.
4. Enter file =src/getters.rs=, and swap out the two use statements. This bit:
#+begin_src rust
// comment the following line and uncomment out the next use statement to successfully build.
use crate::{near_bindgen, AccountId, Marketplace, MarketplaceContract};
//use crate::*; //::{near_bindgen, AccountId, Marketplace, MarketplaceContract};
#+end_src

5. Rebuild (any method). Succeed.

What changed: We imported everything individually, as opposed to with a glob.

Did we miss an import? Nope. =use crate::*= just appears to be the only way to import things now.

Suggested change on NEAR's behalf: document this or change it.
